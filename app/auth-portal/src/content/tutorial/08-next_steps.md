## Next Steps

### What's next for the product?

Here are some of the things we'll be working on:

* Making it easy to add new functionality and share it
* Adding more coverage for assets, in particular, AWS services
* Discovery and bidirectional updates (building a model from your resources and updating models from resources)
* Production deployments
* A "Bring Your Own Cloud" SaaS offering

### Talk to us

We love feedback and engaging with users on their experience using System Initiative! We encourage you to ask questions about how things work, where we're heading, your thoughts and suggestions, DevOps, philosophy, etc.

[Let's talk on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/system-init).

### Schedule an interview

Weâ€™d love to schedule a half-hour Zoom with you to get your feedback on System Initiative. [Please schedule time with Adam Jacob (CEO), Mark Dennard (Director of UX), and Anna Saulwick (Director of Product) via our Calendly](https://calendly.com/d/2gm-dhd-xvq/system-initiative-feedback-session).

### Collaborate

We're excited for DevOps builders to get involved and start modeling and building systems in System Initiative, so please join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/system-init), talk about the Assets you want to see, and start making stuff with us! 

### Use System Initiative for real

You're someone who likes to try things early and is willing to deal with the rough edges - we are too. If you've got a project that you think is a good fit for using System Initiative, let us know, and we can get together to understand more about it and what you'll need to see in the product to be successful.
