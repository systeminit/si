# Cookie Notice 

_Effective as of March 31, 2023._

This Cookie Notice explains how System Initiative, Inc. ("**System Initiative**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**") uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our website – [https://www.systeminit.com/](https://www.systeminit.com/) – and any other website that we own or control and which posts or links to this Cookie Notice (collectively, the "**Sites**").

You do not need to allow cookies to visit most of the Sites. However, enabling cookies may allow for a more tailored browsing experience and is required for certain parts of the Sites to work. 

For further information about this Cookie Notice, please contact us at [info@systeminit.com](mailto:info@systeminit.com).

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.  

**What are the key concepts?**

<u>First-party cookies</u>. These cookies are served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites.

<u>Third-party cookies</u>. They are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie. Third-party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social media features.

<u>Persistent cookies</u>. They are cookies that remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

<u>Session cookies.</u> These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

**What are the categories and purposes of the cookies used on the Sites?**

We use “strictly necessary”, “functional”, and “analytics” cookies on our Sites:

<u>Strictly necessary cookies.</u>

These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Sites will not then work. We use these strictly necessary cookies to identify you as being logged in to the Sites and to authenticate you, to make sure you connect to the right service on the Sites when we make any changes to the way it works and for security purposes.

<u>Functional cookies</u>.

These cookies enable the Sites to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. We use functional cookies to enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality and personalization. These cookies may be set by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.

<u>Analytics cookies.</u>

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Sites and gather information on error messages. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our Sites and will not be able to monitor its performance.

We use analytics cookies to perform web analytics and for error management purposes, by measuring any errors that may occur.

**What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies do we use on the Sites?**

**Other technologies**

In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as local storage or pixel tags to collect information automatically.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Browser Web Storage.</span>

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Web Beacons.</span>

We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.


# Your choices

You can decide not to accept cookies or other technologies. If you do not accept our cookies or other technologies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device, you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites, and some functionality may not work.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cookie Preference Centre.</span>

You can change the cookie settings when you visit our Sites via our Cookie Banner that is displayed to you when you first visit our Sites, or at any time by visiting the [Cookie Preference Centre](https://www.systeminit.com/legal/cookie). Our Cookie Banner and Cookie Preference Center allow you to accept, refuse or manage the setting of all or some cookies:



* Strictly necessary cookies do not require your consent. 
* When we deploy other cookies, you have the possibility to either accept or reject all cookies, or to allow the deployment of the categories of cookies you prefer, by clicking on the appropriate button (i.e. “accept all”, “reject all” or “manage my settings”). 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blocking cookies in your browser</span>.

Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful. Otherwise, you should use the “Help” option in your internet browser for more details:



* [Cookie settings in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/search?query=enable%20cookies%20in%20edge)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blocking images/clear gifs. </span>

Most browsers and devices allow you to configure your device to prevent images from loading. To do this, follow the instructions in your particular browser or device settings.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Third-party opt-out option. </span>

You can opt-out of interest-based advertising through some of the third parties listed in the chart above by using the corresponding third-party opt-out tool provided in the chart. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Industry association opt-outs</span>. 

You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms linked above.

If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites.

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.

For more information about how we collect, use and share your information, see our [Privacy Policy](https://auth.systeminit.com/legal/privacy).
