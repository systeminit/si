# Cookie Notice

_Effective as of March 31, 2023._

This Cookie Notice explains how System Initiative, Inc. ("**System Initiative**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**")uses
cookies and similar technologies in connection with our
website – [https://www.systeminit.com/](https://www.systeminit.com/) – and any other website that we own or control and
which posts or links to this Cookie Notice (collectively, the "**Sites**").

You do not need to allow cookies to visit most of the Sites. However, enabling cookies may allow for a more tailored
browsing experience and is required for certain parts of the Sites to work.

For further information about this Cookie Notice, please contact us
at [info@systeminit.com](mailto:info@systeminit.com).

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve
different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently,
remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.

**What are the key concepts?**

<u>First-party cookies</u>. These cookies are served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to
recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites.

<u>Third-party cookies</u>. They are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by
the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party
cookie. Third-party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social
media features.

<u>Persistent cookies</u>. They are cookies that remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the
cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

<u>Session cookies.</u> These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A
browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session
cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

**What are the categories and purposes of the cookies used on the Sites?**

We use “strictly necessary”, “functional”, and “analytics” cookies on our Sites:

<u>Strictly necessary cookies.</u>

These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only
set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences,
logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of
the Sites will not then work. We use these strictly necessary cookies to identify you as being logged in to the Sites
and to authenticate you, to make sure you connect to the right service on the Sites when we make any changes to the way
it works and for security purposes.

<u>Functional cookies</u>.

These cookies enable the Sites to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third
party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these
services may not function properly. We use functional cookies to enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality
and personalization. These cookies may be set by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.

<u>Analytics cookies.</u>

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites.
They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Sites and gather
information on error messages. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our Sites and
will not be able to monitor its performance.

We use analytics cookies to perform web analytics and for error management purposes, by measuring any errors that may
occur.

**What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies do we use on the Sites?**

On the Sites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies in the following categories described in the table below.

| Name of the cookie | Category and purpose                                                           | Duration of the cookie                             | Who serves the cookie   | How to control the cookie                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Other technologies**

In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as local storage or pixel tags to collect information
automatically.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Browser Web Storage.</span>

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar
purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser
may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Web Beacons.</span>

We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted
emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on
the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within
HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was
viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile
statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

# Your choices

You can decide not to accept cookies or other technologies. If you do not accept our cookies or other technologies, you
may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer
or mobile device, you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites, and some functionality may not work.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cookie Preference Centre.</span>

You can change the cookie settings when you visit our Sites via our Cookie Banner that is displayed to you when you
first visit our Sites, or at any time by visiting the Cookie Preference Centre at https://www.systeminit.com and
clicking "Cookie Policy" in the footer. Our Cookie Banner and Cookie Preference Centre allow you to accept, refuse or
manage the setting of all or some cookies:

* Strictly necessary cookies do not require your consent.
* When we deploy other cookies, you have the possibility to either accept or reject all cookies, or to allow the
  deployment of the categories of cookies you prefer, by clicking on the appropriate button (i.e. “accept all”, “reject
  all” or “manage my settings”).

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blocking cookies in your browser</span>.

Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many
browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. In order to understand these settings, the following
links may be helpful. Otherwise, you should use the “Help” option in your internet browser for more details:

* [Cookie settings in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/search?query=enable%20cookies%20in%20edge)
* [Cookie settings in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Cookies)
* [Cookie settings in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647)
* [Cookie settings in Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1677)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blocking images/clear gifs. </span>

Most browsers and devices allow you to configure your device to prevent images from loading. To do this, follow the
instructions in your particular browser or device settings.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Third-party opt-out option. </span>

You can opt-out of interest-based advertising through some of the third parties listed in the chart above by using the
corresponding third-party opt-out tool provided in the chart.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Industry association opt-outs</span>.

You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising
Initiative by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the Digital Advertising Alliance by
clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own
opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms linked above.

If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may
not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites.

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be
relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are
included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not
listed.

For more information about how we collect, use and share your information, see
our [Privacy Policy](https://auth.systeminit.com/legal/privacy).
