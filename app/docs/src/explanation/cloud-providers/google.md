# Google Cloud Support in System Initiative

System Initiative supports Google Cloud resources through the
[Google API Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery). We
automatically generate coverage using the latest stable API versions. If a
stable version is not available, we use the latest preview release to maintain
functionality and access to new features.

We support authentication through:

- [Google Cloud Service Accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)

If this does not cover a use case you need, please
[contact us](https://calendly.com/d/cw8r-6rq-b3n/share-your-use-case-with-system-initiative)
or send an email to <help@systeminit.com> so we can extend support as needed.

## Connecting System Initiative to your Google Cloud Account

To use Google Cloud from within System Initiative, you need to use a
`Google Cloud Credential` component. If you create that component, it will then
prompt you for the credential setup supported above.
