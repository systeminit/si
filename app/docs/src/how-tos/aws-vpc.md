# How to Create and Manage an AWS VPC

This how-to assumes:

- Basic [familiarity with System Initiative](../tutorials/getting-started)
- Are familiar with [AWS VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)

It will teach you how to create a best practice AWS VPC and manage it with
System Initiative.

We will cover:

- The creation of a highly available VPC that spans multiple availability zones.
- A VPC configured with public and private subnets.
- The networking required to allow outbound traffic for resources on the private
  subnets.
- The networking required for the communication with the internet.

## What it will look like when completed

When you have completed this guide, you should have Components that look like
this in your Grid:

![AWS VPC Diagram](./aws-vpc/aws-vpc-complete-grid.png)

and like this in your Map:

![AWS VPC Diagram](./aws-vpc/aws-vpc-complete-map.png)

## Create a Change Set

![Create a Change Set](./aws-vpc/create-change-set.png)

Create a Change Set named `How-to VPC`.

## Create AWS Credentials

Press `N` (or click `Add a component`) search for `AWS Credential`, select it then hit `Enter` to create an `AWS Credential` Component.

![Create AWS Credentials 1](./aws-vpc/create-aws-credentials-1.png)

Now configure your AWS Credentials to a valid AWS account, and press `Add Secret`, hit `Esc` to return to the Grid. You now have a valid AWS Credential component to use for this VPC.

![Create AWS Credentials 2](./aws-vpc/create-aws-credentials-2.png)

## Select an AWS Region

Press `N`, then search for, select and add an `AWS Region` to your Change Set. Name the Component, `AWS Region`, set the `region` property to`us-east-1` and Subscribe the credential property to your AWS Credential. Hit `Esc` to return to the Grid.

![Select an AWS Region](./aws-vpc/select-an-aws-region.png)

## Create a VPC Component

Press `N`, then search for, select and add an `AWS::EC2::VPC` Component.

Set the Component name to be `How to VPC`.

Set the `CidrBlock` property to `10.0.0.0/16`

Set `EnableDnsHostnames` to true.

Set `EnableDnsSupport` to true.

Subscribe the `region` property to your AWS Region.

Subscribe the `credential` property to your AWS Credential.

![Create a VPC Component](./aws-vpc/create-a-vpc-component.png)

Press `Esc` to return to the Grid.

## Create the Public Subnet Components

This VPC will span multiple availability zones in our AWS Region. Add a
`AWS::EC2::Subnet` Component to your Change Set, then right click it, and press `D` to duplicate the Component (add a prefix to each duplicate of `Public` if you like) until you have 3 of them.

![Duplicate the Public Subnet Component](./aws-vpc/create-public-subnet.png)

Then Configure them as follows:

| Component Name | `CidrBlock`   | `AvailabilityZone` | `MapPublicIpOnLaunch` |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Public 1       | 10.0.128.0/20 | us-east-1a         | true                  |
| Public 2       | 10.0.144.0/20 | us-east-1b         | true                  |
| Public 3       | 10.0.160.0/20 | us-east-1c         | true                  |

Subscribe the VpcId property to your `AWS::EC2::VPC` Component named `How to VPC`, for each of the Subnets.

Subscribe to your `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties for each of the Subnets. When you are done with Subnet 3, press `Esc` to return to the Grid.

## Create the Elastic IP Components

Add an `AWS::EC2::EIP` Component to the Grid, hit `Esc` then duplicate (`D`) until you have 3 of them.

Set the names of the Components to be `NAT Gateway EIP (1|2|3)` - the index
should align with each of the Subnets, and match the corresponding `NAT Gateway` Components.

Set the `Domain` of each of the Elastic IP Components to be `vpc`.

Subscribe to your `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties for each of the NAT Gateway EIP Components.

![Create the Elastic IPs for each NAT Gateway](./aws-vpc/create-elastic-ip.png)

Press `Esc` to return to the Grid.

## Create the NAT Gateway Components

Add an `AWS::EC2::NATGateway` Component to the Grid, hit `Esc` then duplicate (`D`) until you have 3 of them.

Set name names of each of the Components to be `NAT Gateway (1|2|3)` - the index should
align with each subnet.

In NatGateway 1, subscribe the `SubnetId` property to your `AWS::EC2::Subnet` Component named `Public 1`. Repeat this for NatGateway 2 and 3 to subscribe to the matching `SubnetId` properties.

In NatGateway 1, subscribe the `AllocationId` property to your `AWS::EC2::EIP` Component named `NAT Gateway EIP 1`. Repeat this for NatGateway 2 and 3 to subscribe to the matching `AllocationId` properties.

![Create the NAT Gateway Components](./aws-vpc/create-nat-gateway.png)

Set the `ConnectivityType` of each of the NAT Gateway Components to be `public`.

Subscribe to your `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties for each of the NAT Gateway Components.

Press `Esc` to return to the Grid.

## Current State of Play

Let's take a look at what we have in our Workspace so far.

![Current State of Play Grid](./aws-vpc/current-state-of-play-grid.png)

You can see all the components you have created so far in descending order. In the Actions panel on the right hand side you can see there are 17 Actions queued - these are all the real world resources that will be created once you apply your change set.

If you click the `Map` button in the top left of the Grid, you seen the visual relationship between the components are creating:

![Current State of Play Map](./aws-vpc/current-state-of-play-map.png)

Where the Components are placed on this Map is determined by the dependant property Subscriptions.

## Create the Private Subnet Components

On the Map, press the `N` key, search for Subnet, select `AWS::EC2::Subnet` and press `Enter`.

As we need 3 Private Subnets, press `Esc` to return to the Map from the Component editor, right click the new Subnet Component and Duplicate it twice.

Add 3 `AWS::EC2::Subnet` Components to your VPC frame and configure them as follows:

| Component name | `CidrBlock`  | `AvailabilityZone` |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Private 1      | 10.0.0.0/19  | us-east-1a         |
| Private 2      | 10.0.32.0/19 | us-east-1b         |
| Private 3      | 10.0.64.0/19 | us-east-1c         |

Subscribe the `VpcId` property to the `VpcId` of the How to VPC Component for each Private Subnet.

Subscribe the `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties in each Private Subnet.

![Create the Private Subnet Components](./aws-vpc/create-private-subnet.png)

Here you can see the 3 Private Subnet components and their property Subscriptions. Click the Grid button in the top left of the screen to return to the Grid.

## Create the Private Route Table Components

For each of the `Private` Subnets, we will need to create an `AWS::EC2::RouteTable` Component.

Set the names to be `Private Route Table 1(2|3)` - the index should align with
the subnet.

Subscribe the `VpcId` property to the `VpcId` of the How to VPC Component for each Private Route table.

Subscribe the `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties in each Private Route table.

![Create the Private Route Table Components](./aws-vpc/create-private-route-table.png)

## Create the Private Route Components

Add a `AWS::EC2::Route` Component for each of the `Private Route Table` Components.

Set the Component name to be `Route to Internet (1|2|3)` - the index should
align with the Private Route Tables you just created.

Subscribe the `RouteTableId` property to the `RouteTableId` of the corresponding Private Route Table Component.

Set `DestinationCidrBlock` to be `0.0.0.0/0`.

Subscribe to the corresponding `NATGatewayId` property of each existing `NAT Gateway` Component. E.g. `Route to Internet 1` subscribes to the `NatGatewayId` of the NAT Gateway 1 Component.

Subscribe to the `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties.

![Create the Private Route Components](./aws-vpc/create-private-route.png)

Press `Esc` to return to the Grid.

## Create the Private Subnet Route Table Associations

Add a `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation` Component for each of the `Private Route Table` Components.

Set the name of each of the association components to be `Private (1|2|3) Assocation`.

Subscribe the `RouteTableId` property to the `RouteTableId` of the corresponding Private Route Table Component.

Subscribe the `SubnetId` property to the `SubnetId` of the corresponding Private Subnet Component.

Subscribe to the `Region` and `AWS Credential` properties.

![Create the Private Subnet Route Table Associations](./aws-vpc/create-private-subnet-route-table-association.png)

Press `Esc` to return to your Grid.

## Apply your Change Set

Now you can see a scrollable list of 29 pending Create Actions, and all of the individual Components on the Grid required for you to create your How to VPC!

![All Pending Create Actions](./aws-vpc/all-pending-create-actions.png)

You can also view the Map to see all of your Components:
