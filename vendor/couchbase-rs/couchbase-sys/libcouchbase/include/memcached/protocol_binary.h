 * - MULTI_LOOKUP consists of variable number of subdoc lookup commands

 * - MULTI_MUTATION consists of a variable number of subdoc mutation

 *                  SUBDOC_{GET,EXISTS}).
 *
 * Each path to be operated on is specified by an Operation Spec, which are
 * contained in the body. This defines the opcode, path, and value
 * (for mutations).
 *
 * A maximum of MULTI_MAX_PATHS paths (operations) can be encoded in a
 * single multi-path command.
