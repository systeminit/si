  "The deployment controller type to use.\n The deployment controller is the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for your service. The valid options are:\n  +  ECS\n When you create a service which uses the ``ECS`` deployment controller, you can choose between the following deployment strategies:\n  +  ``ROLLING``: When you create a service which uses the *rolling update* (``ROLLING``) deployment strategy, the ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment configuration. \n Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n  +  Gradual service updates: You need to update your service incrementally without taking the entire service offline at once.\n  +  Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the additional resource costs of running two complete environments simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).\n  +  Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one by one.\n  +  No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.\n  +  Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple environments, target groups, and listeners.\n  +  No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load balancer, ALB, NLB, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green deployments).\n  +  Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.\n  +  Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not running duplicate environments during deployment.\n  \n Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for many common application scenarios.\n  +  ``BLUE_GREEN``: A *blue/green* deployment strategy (``BLUE_GREEN``) is a release methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called blue and green. With ECS blue/green deployments, you can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the ability to quickly roll back if needed.\n ECS blue/green deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:\n  +  Service validation: When you need to validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them\n  +  Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime deployments\n  +  Instant roll back: When you need the ability to quickly roll back if issues are detected\n  +  Load balancer requirement: When your service uses ALB, NLB, or Service Connect\n  \n  \n  +  External\n Use a third-party deployment controller.\n  +  Blue/green deployment (powered by ACD)\n ACD installs an updated version of the application as a new replacement task set and reroutes production traffic from the original application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is terminated after a successful deployment. Use this deployment controller to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it.\n  \n When updating the deployment controller for a service, consider the following depending on the type of migration you're performing.\n  +  If you have a template that contains the ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller information as well as ``TaskSet`` and ``PrimaryTaskSet`` resources, and you remove the task set resources from the template when updating from ``EXTERNAL`` to ``ECS``, the ``DescribeTaskSet`` and ``DeleteTaskSet`` API calls will return a 400 error after the deployment controller is updated to ``ECS``. This results in a delete failure on the task set resources, even though the stack transitions to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE`` status. For more information, see [Resource removed from stack but not deleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-resource-removed-not-deleted) in the CFNlong User Guide.

ES modules aren't supported for inline functions.\n   For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline (``\\n``) with a backslash.\n If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ([cfn-response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html)) that simplifies sending responses.

  "If a service is using the rolling update (``ECS``) deployment type, the ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the ``RUNNING`` or ``PENDING`` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the ``desiredCount`` (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler and has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``maximumPercent`` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default ``maximumPercent`` value for a service using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler is 200%.\n The Amazon ECS scheduler uses this parameter to replace unhealthy tasks by starting replacement tasks first and then stopping the unhealthy tasks, as long as cluster resources for starting replacement tasks are available. For more information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).\n If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types, and tasks in the service use the EC2 launch type, the *maximum percent* value is set to the default value. The *maximum percent* value is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the ``RUNNING`` state while the container instances are in the ``DRAINING`` state.\n  You can't specify a custom ``maximumPercent`` value for a service that uses either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and has tasks that use the EC2 launch type.\n  If the service uses either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types, and the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used. The value is still returned when describing your service.": {
    "enum": null

  "If a service is using the rolling update (``ECS``) deployment type, the ``minimumHealthyPercent`` represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the ``RUNNING`` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the ``desiredCount`` (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``minimumHealthyPercent`` of 50%, the service scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. \n  If any tasks are unhealthy and if ``maximumPercent`` doesn't allow the Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks, the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks one-by-one — using the ``minimumHealthyPercent`` as a constraint — to clear up capacity to launch replacement tasks. For more information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) . \n For services that *do not* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n  +  A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass their health checks.\n  +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a ``RUNNING`` state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  +  If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by the container health check settings. \n  \n For services that *do* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n  +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  +  If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  \n The default value for a replica service for ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is 100%. The default ``minimumHealthyPercent`` value for a service using the ``DAEMON`` service schedule is 0% for the CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.\n The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the ``desiredCount`` multiplied by the ``minimumHealthyPercent``/100, rounded up to the nearest integer value.\n If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *minimum healthy percent* value is set to the default value.
