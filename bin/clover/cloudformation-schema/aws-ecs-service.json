If this option isn't specified, it defaults to false. Your IAM policy must include the logs:CreateLogGroup permission before you attempt to use awslogs-create-group. + awslogs-region Required: Yes Specify the Region that the awslogs log driver is to send your Docker logs to. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs. This is so that they're all visible in one location. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option. + awslogs-group Required: Yes Make sure to specify a log group that the awslogs log driver sends its log streams to. + awslogs-stream-prefix Required: Yes, when using the Fargate launch type.Optional for the EC2 launch type, required for the Fargate launch type. Use the awslogs-stream-prefix option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the format prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id. If you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container instance. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent them with just the Docker container ID (which is only available on the container instance), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option. For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so, you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to. You must specify a stream-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console. + awslogs-datetime-format Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python strftime format. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages. One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry. For more information, see awslogs-datetime-format. You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and awslogs-multiline-pattern options. Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance. + awslogs-multiline-pattern Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages. For more information, see awslogs-multiline-pattern. This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-format is also configured. You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and awslogs-multiline-pattern options. Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance. + mode Required: No Valid values: non-blocking | blocking This option defines the delivery mode of log messages from the container to CloudWatch Logs. The delivery mode you choose affects application availability when the flow of logs from container to CloudWatch is interrupted. If you use the blocking mode and the flow of logs to CloudWatch is interrupted, calls from container code to write to the stdout and stderr streams will block. The logging thread of the application will block as a result. This may cause the application to become unresponsive and lead to container healthcheck failure. If you use the non-blocking mode, the container's logs are instead stored in an in-memory intermediate buffer configured with the max-buffer-size option. This prevents the application from becoming unresponsive when logs cannot be sent to CloudWatch. We recommend using this mode if you want to ensure service availability and are okay with some log loss. For more information, see Preventing log loss with non-blocking mode in the awslogs container log driver. + max-buffer-size Required: No Default value: 1m When non-blocking mode is used, the max-buffer-size log option controls the size of the buffer that's used for intermediate message storage. Make sure to specify an adequate buffer size based on your application. When the buffer fills up, further logs cannot be stored. Logs that cannot be stored are lost. \n To route logs using the ``splunk`` log router, you need to specify a ``splunk-token`` and a ``splunk-url``.\n When you use the ``awsfirelens`` log router to route logs to an AWS Service or AWS Partner Network destination for log storage and analytics, you can set the ``log-driver-buffer-limit`` option to limit the number of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker.\n Other options you can specify when using ``awsfirelens`` to route logs depend on the destination. When you export logs to Amazon Data Firehose, you can specify the AWS Region with ``region`` and a name for the log stream with ``delivery_stream``.\n When you export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can specify an AWS Region with ``region`` and a data stream name with ``stream``.\n  When you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can specify options like ``Name``, ``Host`` (OpenSearch Service endpoint without protocol), ``Port``, ``Index``, ``Type``, ``Aws_auth``, ``Aws_region``, ``Suppress_Type_Name``, and ``tls``. For more information, see [Under the hood: FireLens for Amazon ECS Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/containers/under-the-hood-firelens-for-amazon-ecs-tasks/).\n When you export logs to Amazon S3, you can specify the bucket using the ``bucket`` option. You can also specify ``region``, ``total_file_size``, ``upload_timeout``, and ``use_put_object`` as options.\n This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

If you use the rollback option, when a service deployment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment that completed successfully.

This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler and has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``maximumPercent`` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default ``maximumPercent`` value for a service using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler is 200%.\n The Amazon ECS scheduler uses this parameter to replace unhealthy tasks by starting replacement tasks first and then stopping the unhealthy tasks, as long as cluster resources for starting replacement tasks are available. For more information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).\n If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types, and tasks in the service use the EC2 launch type, the *maximum percent* value is set to the default value.

This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``minimumHealthyPercent`` of 50%, the service scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. \n  If any tasks are unhealthy and if ``maximumPercent`` doesn't allow the Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks, the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks one-by-one — using the ``minimumHealthyPercent`` as a constraint — to clear up capacity to launch replacement tasks. For more information about how the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) . \n For services that *do not* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n  +  A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass their health checks.\n  +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a ``RUNNING`` state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  +  If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by the container health check settings. \n  \n For services that *do* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:\n  +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  +  If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.\n  \n The default value for a replica service for ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is 100%. The default ``minimumHealthyPercent`` value for a service using the ``DAEMON`` service schedule is 0% for the CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.\n The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the ``desiredCount`` multiplied by the ``minimumHealthyPercent``/100, rounded up to the nearest integer value.\n If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *minimum healthy percent* value is set to the default value.
