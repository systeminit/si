Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:\n  +  An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n  +  A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.\n  +  An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n  +  An LAMlong function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.\n  \n There can be as many as two subscription filters associated with a log group.",
