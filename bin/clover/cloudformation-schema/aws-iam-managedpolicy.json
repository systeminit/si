For more information, see [Acknowledging Resources in Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#using-iam-capabilities).\n  Naming an IAM resource can cause an unrecoverable error if you reuse the same template in multiple Regions. To prevent this, we recommend using ``Fn::Join`` and ``AWS::Region`` to create a Region-specific name, as in the following example: ``{\"Fn::Join\": [\"\", [{\"Ref\": \"AWS::Region\"}, {\"Ref\": \"MyResourceName\"}]]}``."

This dependency ensures that the role's policy is available throughout the resource's lifecycle.
