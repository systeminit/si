A tag with the key \"ABC\" is a different tag from one with key \"abc\".\n Stack-level tags, tags you apply to the CloudFormation stack, are also attached to the secret. \n If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an ``Access Denied`` error. For more information, see [Control access to secrets using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html#tag-secrets-abac) and [Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets' tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples.html#auth-and-access_tags2).\n For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json). If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.\n The following restrictions apply to tags:\n  +  Maximum number of tags per secret: 50\n  +  Maximum key length: 127 Unicode characters in UTF-8\n  +  Maximum value length: 255 Unicode characters in UTF-8\n  +  Tag keys and values are case sensitive.\n  +  Do not use the ``aws:`` prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.\n  +  If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, other services might have restrictions on allowed characters.
