For more information, see [CreateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html) in the *API Reference*.\n You should be aware of the following behaviors when working with DDB tables:\n  +   CFNlong typically creates DDB tables in parallel. However, if your template includes multiple DDB tables with indexes, you must declare dependencies so that the tables are created sequentially. DDBlong limits the number of tables with secondary indexes that are in the creating state. If you create multiple tables with indexes at the same time, DDB returns an error and the stack operation fails. For an example, see [DynamoDB Table with a DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html#aws-resource-dynamodb-table--examples--DynamoDB_Table_with_a_DependsOn_Attribute).\n  \n   Our guidance is to use the latest schema documented for your CFNlong templates. This schema supports the provisioning of all table settings below. When using this schema in your CFNlong templates, please ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are updated with appropriate permissions to allow for the authorization of these setting changes.",

Resource-based policies let you define access permissions by specifying who has access to each resource, and the actions they are allowed to perform on each resource.\n In a CFNshort template, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format because CFNshort converts YAML to JSON before submitting it to DDB. For more information about resource-based policies, see [Using resource-based policies for](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.html) and [Resource-based policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-examples.html).\n While defining resource-based policies in your CFNshort templates, the following considerations apply:\n  +  The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document in JSON format is 20 KB. DDB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy against this limit. \n  +  Resource-based policies don't support [drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html#). If you update a policy outside of the CFNshort stack template, you'll need to update the CFNshort stack with the changes.\n  +  Resource-based policies don't support out-of-band changes. If you add, update, or delete a policy outside of the CFNshort template, the change won't be overwritten if there are no changes to the policy within the template.\n For example, say that your template contains a resource-based policy, which you later update outside of the template. If you don't make any changes to the policy in the template, the updated policy in DDB won’t be synced with the policy in the template.\n Conversely, say that your template doesn’t contain a resource-based policy, but you add a policy outside of the template. This policy won’t be removed from DDB as long as you don’t add it to the template. When you add a policy to the template and update the stack, the existing policy in DDB will be updated to match the one defined in the template.\n  \n For a full list of all considerations, see [Resource-based policy considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-considerations.html).",
