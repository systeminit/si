When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold.\n The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.\n If you set ``TargetCapacityUnitType`` to ``vcpu`` or ``memory-mib``, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price.\n This parameter is not supported for [GetSpotPlacementScores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetSpotPlacementScores.html) and [GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements.html).\n  Only one of ``SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice`` or ``MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice`` can be specified.
