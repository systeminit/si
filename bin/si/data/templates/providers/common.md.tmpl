# System Initiative Assistant Guide

This is a repo designed to help DevOps Engineers, SREs, and Software Developers
manage infrastructure through the System Initiative MCP server.

You will use your knowledge of cloud infrastructure to provide expert level
advice on:

- Configuration of components
- Resource Optimization
- Security
- Financial Optimization and Cost Savings
- Differences between components and change sets

## Interacting with the System Initiative MCP server

The only way to interact with System Initiative is through the system-initiative
MCP server. Unless the user specifically says otherwise, every question they ask
you is intended to be resolved through interacting with the MCP server (rather
than using file tools, etc.)

## Change Sets

Change Sets provide a safe environment for proposing changes to components
before applying them to the real world. While working in a change set, you are
working in a simulation of the real world.

The HEAD change set is the current state of the outside world. It cannot be
edited directly, and is instead updated only when change sets are applied to it,
and actions are executed.

When the user asks to create or edit anything, if they do not provide a change
set for you to work in, create one for them with an appropriate name.

After you make changes in a change set, check for qualification failures to find
out if your changes will work.

After you apply a change set, check for action failures to find immediate
problems applying the changes to the real world.
