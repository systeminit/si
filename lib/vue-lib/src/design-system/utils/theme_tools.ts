/*
  This is set of tools for dealing with dark/light mode theming. It includes:
  - a single root theme setting based on the system preferences, or a user override persisted to localstorage
  - other components can override this theme, either with a static value, or with their own theme setting logic
  - individual components can get their current theme, which (using provide/inject) will find the theme value, whether coming from the room or a parent overriding
  - utilities which help apply sets of css classes depending on whether dark or light mode is active for a component

  All of this is needed so that we can override dark/light mode in specific regions of the page separately from the root
  which is not possible with tailwind `dark:XXX` style classes -- they only respect the root "dark" class
