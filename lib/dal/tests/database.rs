// changes to queries and migrations. In addition, it alphabetically comes before "integration_test"
// so itâ€™ll fail fast in CI, but please note: tests should never be reliant on order, this is more
// of a side benefit. Even if that benefit did not exist, tests from this module could still be
// good to look for in CI failures to reduce "developer WTF time"... but that also might not be
// too useful since you'll likely see a bunch of integration tests failing anyway.
