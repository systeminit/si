//! An tree structure over an arbitrary node type that is cryptographically hashed as a Merkle
//! n-ary acyclic directed graph (i.e. a Merkle DAG).
//!
//! # Supporting Reference Literature
//!
//! - [Graphs in Rust: An Introduction to Petgraph][0]: A good primer for using the Petgraph Rust
//! crate, especially considering that the crate's documentation is often terse and lacking in
//! examples.
//! - [Iterative Depth First Traversal of Graph][1]: The description of an algorithm to perform a
//! depth-first traversal (*DFS*) of a tree in an iterative fashion. In general here we are
//! avoiding recursive algorithms as the inputs to these trees can be user provided so it is hard
//! to know the depth of such trees ahead of time.
//! - [Iterative Postorder Traversal of N-ary Tree][2]: The description of an algorithm to perform
//! a depth-first (*DFS*) post-order traversal of an n-ary tree (i.e. more than 2 children). This
//! is the algorithm required to compute the hashes for a Merkle tree. That is, children must be
//! hashed before the parent can be hashed.
//! - [No More Tears, No More Knots: Arena-Allocated Trees in Rust][3]: A good article explaining
//! the challenges when working with ownership and trees in Rust. Covers arena-allocated trees,
//! which is a strategy that Petgraph's default `Graph` implementation uses.
//! - [Mutable post-order iterator over tree structure][4]: A Rust users thread discussing
//! challenges while traversing a graph and mutating nodes. A key insight is to use arena
//! allocation for ownership of the graph's nodes.
//! [Idiomatic tree and graph like structures in Rust][5]: Short write-up explaining Rust
//! ownership, trees, and the common solution of using memory arenas.
//! - [Graph & Tree Traversals in Rust][6]: Covers Rust memory ownership rules, the idea of arena
//! allocators and the Visitor Pattern as strategies to perfom immutable and mutable tree
//! traversals.
//! - [Rust Unofficial Design Patterns: Visitor][7]: A visitor encapsulates an algorithm that
//! operates over a heterogeneous collection of objects.
//! - [Advanced Data Structures Part 1: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)][8]: Introduction to Directed
//! Acyclic Graphs (*DAG*).
//! - [Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)][9]: Chapter from "Version Control by Example" which covers
//! DAGs
//! - [Wikipedia: Merkle tree][10]: Introduction to Merkle trees and their uses (hint: we're using
//! non-binary aka n-ary Merkle trees in this crate)
//! - [IPFS: What is a Merkle DAG?][11]: Short description of a Merkle DAG, that is an n-ary tree
//! and non-leaf nodes can contain data (hint: we're using Merkle DAGs in this crate)
