# The custom platform for SI. This is taken from the prelude, but includes our customizations for
# rust build flags.
#
# Essentially, we should be adding any custom configuration into root//config, and then plumbing it
# through the execution_platform defined below.
#
# To actually add new configuration, you'll extend the relevant python function to output the
# correct configuration info, and then you can use it in a select() statement at will.

# This is mostly here for a rule type to add a dependency on it to mark all

# toolchains are currently all exec deps and so cannot do that. We'd like
# buck2 to support a form of dep that inherited its users execution platform
# so that toolchains could basically get visibility and affect both target and
# execution configuration, but that's not implemented yet.
