# Install the Couchbase Controller

You have to install the Couchbase operator, controller, etc.
Follow the instructions here:

https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/current/install-admission-controller.html

# Add secrets

Unfortunately, this just has to be done by hand. Get the secrets from Adam, 
and then you can load them in. Or get them k8s.

# Deploy

The deployment nominally uses kustomize, at least once its driven by
CI.

You can `kubectl apply -k ./deployment` and things should work.
